# Traffic-Congestion-Analysis
Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on the analysis of traffic congestion. The project utilizes a dataset with information about traffic congestion at different junctions, including DateTime, Junction, Vehicles, and ID.

Dashboard

The project includes a dashboard that provides the following analyses:

1. Sum of Junctions by Vehicles:
   - Visualizes the total number of vehicles at each junction.

2. Count of ID:
   - Displays the total count of unique IDs in the dataset.

3. Count of ID by Years of Junction:
   - Breaks down the count of unique IDs by the years of junction.

4. Sum of Junction by Vehicles ID:
   - Shows the sum of vehicles at each junction grouped by unique IDs.

 Code Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis (`your_dataset.csv`).
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `dashboard/`: Includes files related to the dashboard, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

 Usage

To replicate the analysis and run the dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashag8218/Traffic-Congestion-Analysis.git
   cd traffic-congestion-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Access the dashboard by opening the HTML file in a web browser:

   ```
   dashboard/index.html
   ```

 Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels (for time series decomposition)

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
